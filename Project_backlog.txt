Top News Web App:
______________________________________________________________________________
 
Ideas:
-Pulls data from selected sms feeds, twitter, web sites (maybe?), etc...
-Customizable (user selects which feeds they want, drag and drop layout, drop down menu, etc.)
-Genre selection (world news, local news, sports, finance, weather, etc...)
-Buttons: home, back, forward, genre, and search
 
Product Backlog:
-Get a firm grasp of JavaScript/HTML
-Create the overall layout for the webpage (logo?)
-Add buttons (home, back, forward, category, search)
-Obtain data from news sources according to the category (which could be a drop-down menu)
-Retrieve and display data on click
-Link up the back and forward buttons
-Implement the search engine
-Implement the home tab (user is able to customize the page layout by adding genre and dragging/dropping genre sections per their liking)
-Add other interactive features (picture for each section, animation, etc.)
